### Day 55: July 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked more with System classes in C#.

### Day 54: June 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about static fields and methods. Started playing with some of the System C# classes.

### Day 53: June 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about creating, using, and releasing objects. Also learned about constructors.

**Thoughts:** Not sure why but knowing how constructors work and when to use them has become a lot easier to me. I remember learning about them in my Java classes a few years ago. I had know clue what I was doing and what they were for.

### Day 52: June 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed classes and objects in C#.

**Thoughts:** I've been fighting a stomach bug all night and day but I still managed to get a little work in. Going to be working with creating and using objects tomorrow.

### Day 51: June 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished studying and working with recursion for now. Moving on to learning about objects.

**Thoughts:** Moving on from recursion. I feel like I've read about and worked with it enough to get the gist of how it works and how it's used but I'm not fully proficient with reading and using the technique for all the solutions it's useful for. I will definitely return to practice and work with recursion in the future but for now I am going to give myself a break from it and move on to learning about objects.

### Day 50: June 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working with recursion.

**Thoughts:** Glad to hit the half way mark of the challenge but frustrated with figuring out some of these recursive solutions.

### Day 49: June 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about direct and indirect recursion. Also learned about when to use recursion vs iteration.

**Thoughts:** Hopefully about to wrap up studying recursion and move on to working with objects.

### Day 48: June 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up my repos on GitHub. Returned to studying recursion.

### Day 47: June 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished my calculator project. Also listened to a few #CodeNewbie podcast episodes.

**Today's Progress**: Still finishing my calculator project in C#.

### Day 45: June 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: (Yesterday) Continued working on the calculator project.

**Thoughts:** Hoping to finish the project and push to GitHub today (6/22). Then I will get back to focusing on recursion. It's been nice to just work on a project and take a break from studying and learning concepts.

### Day 44: June 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Took a break from studying recursion and worked on a desktop calculator using C#.

### Day 43: June 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Studied using recursion for Fibonacci numbers and factorials.

### Day 42: June 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished and pushed my blog post. Read more about recursion.

**Thoughts:** I'm not going to tweet about writing blog posts or include them in my logs anymore. Just going to write as I learn and drop the posts when they are done and then tweet links to them.

### Day 41: June 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished my blog post but still need to edit and push it.

### Day 40: June 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on my next blog post. Read more about recursion.

**Thoughts:** I can tell I'll be studying recursion for the next few days. The book I'm studying gets pretty deep into it and from what I've scanned it looks like some of the examples and ideas can get pretty complicated.

### Day 39: June 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on my next blog post. Listened to a couple of CodeNewbie podcasts (yes I'm counting informative programming/tech podcasts as part of my 100 DOC).

**Thoughts:** I also participated in my first CodeNewbie chat on Twitter. It was pretty sweet. I look forward to joining more.

### Day 38: June 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on a blog post. Started reading about recursion.

**Thoughts:** I've studied recursion before in one of my CS classes. I'm glad to go back over it in this book I've been studying. I think it is important for programmers to understand recursion. 

### Day 37: June 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished studying methods in C#. Started working on a new blog post.

### Day 36: June 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working with methods. Learned more about optional parameters, named arguments, and method overloading.

**Thoughts:** I feel good about what I remember from working with methods while reading and working through this chapter. It has been really easy to understand.

### Day 33: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Submitted my first PR. Continued reading about numeral systems.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good about my first pull request even if it was just a change to some text on a page. I'm glad it was with freeCodeCamp. They are an awesome group. I actually learned a lot.

### Day 32: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: (Yesterday) Spent all of my time trying to setup Node.js and MongoDB for testing.

**Thoughts:** This is to test a simple update that I wanted to contribute to freeCodeCamp. Most of my issues were installing MongoDB on my machine. I will hack at it again today.

### Day 31: June 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: (Yesterday) Completed a few exercises from my coding book working with binary. Read about submitting pull requests and contributing to open source.

**Thoughts:** Reading about contributing to open source got me pumped up. Found an issue on freeCodeCamp's issue log that I think I can help with and submit my first PR.

### Day 30: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read more about numeral systems. Made some minor tweaks to my blog site. Practiced using git.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm progressing more and getting better with git. Every day is adding more to the momentum of creating an everyday habit and learning this stuff.

### Day 29: June 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Woke up early and practiced using different arrays in C#. Started reading about numeral systems.

**Thoughts:** I've learned about numeral systems before and worked with binary and hexadecimal numbers but never mastered how to convert and perform operations on them without having to look up references. Not sure how much time I want to put into this topic or if it's even necessary to master it.

### Day 28: June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about multidimensional arrays, jagged arrays, and memory allocation.

**Thoughts:** I plan on working with arrays more tomorrow and creating some gists. Then I will move on to numeral systems.

### Day 27: May 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked with arrays more and added more code snippets to my collection of C# gists.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good. I have almost 50 gists of C# code snippets from the things I've been learning. I like working with arrays.

### Day 23: May 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Struggled more working on my blog. Determined to keep pushing and get it right.

### Day 22: May 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Figured out what I did wrong to mess up the repo for my site. For the sake of time I'm going to start over with it.

### Day 21: May 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent all my time proof reading and formatting my blog in Markdown. Then I broke my site trying to push the changes.

**Thoughts:** Pretty frustrated at the amount of time I've spent working on this blog post and still don't have it posted. Not to mention being frustrated with not being able to push my changes correctly with git and breaking my site. Not sure if I will be able to figure out how to fix all the mistakes. May just have to delete the repo and start all over. Also might try the GitHub desktop app since I apparently don't have a clue what I'm doing with git.

### Day 20: May 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Studied and practiced arrays. Finished drafting my blog post. Will post tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Missed a couple of days but got a good session in today. Hopefully about to go on a long streak

### Day 16: May 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use the DateTime structure and format time and dates in C#.

**Thoughts:** Had fun playing with the different custom formats that could be used to display the time and dates. I should write a long blog post about all the stuff I've learned about formatting different strings in the last three days.

### Day 15: May 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up all my gists of code snippets and created a long one about formatting output in C#.

**Link to work:** https://jrliv.github.io

### Day 3: May 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working with Hugo. Getting more comfortable with git. Deployed a test page to GitHub Pages.

**Thoughts:** Feeling more confident using Hugo and git. Going to choose a theme tomorrow and start creating the pages and content.

### Day 2: May 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked more with Hugo and played with a few themes for my blog. Learning more about the structure and how things tie together.

**Thoughts:** I assumed using a static site generator would be really fast and easy but the learning curve was a little more than I expected. However I've spent a good chunk of time with it these last two days so I'm going to keep hacking at it. Also I'm still convinced that I would rather have a free static site hosted on GitHub Pages rather than deal with any expenses or security issues from a self hosted CMS or SaaS CMS.

### Day 1: May 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: (Last night) Starting a personal blog. Fought with Hugo static site generator and git. Can't get any themes to load.

**Thoughts:** I thought by the end of the night I would have a template site working with some changes already being made but I can't get any themes to work. I will try again today.
