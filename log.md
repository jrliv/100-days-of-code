# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 28: June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about multidimensional arrays, jagged arrays, and memory allocation.

**Thoughts:** I plan on working with arrays more tomorrow and creating some gists. Then I will move on to numeral systems.

### Day 27: May 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked with arrays more and added more code snippets to my collection of C# gists.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good. I have almost 50 gists of C# code snippets from the things I've been learning. I like working with arrays.

### Day 25: May 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: (Yesterday) Learned how to use the as and null-coalescing operators as well as how to negate Boolean expressions.

**Thoughts:** Glad to take a break from working on my blog and get back to learning about actual code.

### Day 24: May 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally have my site back up and my first blog post.

**Thoughts:** I think I have the workflow down for updating my site now. Ready to focus on code again.

### Day 23: May 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Struggled more working on my blog. Determined to keep pushing and get it right.

### Day 22: May 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Figured out what I did wrong to mess up the repo for my site. For the sake of time I'm going to start over with it.

### Day 21: May 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent all my time proof reading and formatting my blog in Markdown. Then I broke my site trying to push the changes.

**Thoughts:** Pretty frustrated at the amount of time I've spent working on this blog post and still don't have it posted. Not to mention being frustrated with not being able to push my changes correctly with git and breaking my site. Not sure if I will be able to figure out how to fix all the mistakes. May just have to delete the repo and start all over. Also might try the GitHub desktop app since I apparently don't have a clue what I'm doing with git.

### Day 20: May 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Studied and practiced arrays. Finished drafting my blog post. Will post tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Missed a couple of days but got a good session in today. Hopefully about to go on a long streak 

### Day 19: May 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Not much time today. Got up early and worked on my blog. Also spent more time studying conditionals and loops.

### Day 18: May 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Wrote some code in C# earlier today. Got my domain name working with my blog. Started working on my first blog post.

**Thoughts:** Glad my domain name is working and things are moving along.

### Day 17: May 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed some exercises for my C# programming book. Attempted to setup my domain name with my blog on GitHub Pages.

**Thoughts:** I hope the domain and the site work.

### Day 16: May 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use the DateTime structure and format time and dates in C#.

**Thoughts:** Had fun playing with the different custom formats that could be used to display the time and dates. I should write a long blog post about all the stuff I've learned about formatting different strings in the last three days.

### Day 15: May 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up all my gists of code snippets and created a long one about formatting output in C#.

### Day 14: May 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Practiced formatting strings and using conditional statements. Started reviewing loops.

**Thoughts:** Glad to keep moving on. I plan on creating more gists for the stuff I've been learning.

### Day 13: May 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went over conditional statements more and studied if, if-else, and switch statements.

**Thoughts:** Missed yesterday but glad to get back on track.

### Day 12: May 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Played with escape sequences and string literals. Started reviewing conditional statements.

**Thoughts:** Had fun playing with escape sequences. Hope to get a good day in tomorrow.

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed console input and output in C#.

### Day 10: May 10, 2017

### Day 7: May 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Didn't write any code but I learned more about literals and started reviewing operators and expressions.

**Thoughts:** Not too motivated today. Hope to put in more time tomorrow.

### Day 6: May 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: (From yesterday) Reviewed value and reference types in C#. Wrote a few small programs for the exercises in the book I'm studying.

**Thoughts:** Had fun writing some of the programs for the exercises. Also had fun playing around with a few test programs.

### Day 5: May 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Studying C# again. Read about code decompilation and worked with ILSpy. Reviewed data types.

**Thoughts:** Code decompilation is pretty cool.

### Day 4: May 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I need to tweak some things and add content but I have a blog site on GitHub Pages now.

**Thoughts:** Excited to have a blog online where I can document and share my learning.

### Day 3: May 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working with Hugo. Getting more comfortable with git. Deployed a test page to GitHub Pages.

**Thoughts:** Feeling more confident using Hugo and git. Going to choose a theme tomorrow and start creating the pages and content.

### Day 2: May 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked more with Hugo and played with a few themes for my blog. Learning more about the structure and how things tie together.

**Thoughts:** I assumed using a static site generator would be really fast and easy but the learning curve was a little more than I expected. However I've spent a good chunk of time with it these last two days so I'm going to keep hacking at it. Also I'm still convinced that I would rather have a free static site hosted on GitHub Pages rather than deal with any expenses or security issues from a self hosted CMS or SaaS CMS.

### Day 1: May 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: (Last night) Starting a personal blog. Fought with Hugo static site generator and git. Can't get any themes to load.

**Thoughts:** I thought by the end of the night I would have a template site working with some changes already being made but I can't get any themes to work. I will try again today.
