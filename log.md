# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 100: August 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on my ASP .NET MVC project and my blog site.

**Thoughts**: Wish I could have finished my project before ending the challenge but it didn't happen. I still need to learn and figure some things out with my model and DB. Also need to continue working on my personal site. I'm glad I completed the challenge.

### Day 99: August 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on my project. Finished adding archive and projects pages to my blog site.

**Thoughts**: My projects page isn't the best and really my projects themselves aren't either but they are definitely a good start I think. I will continue to update my projects page to display my work better. I will update the projects themselves in some cases as well.

### Day 51: June 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished studying and working with recursion for now. Moving on to learning about objects.

**Thoughts:** Moving on from recursion. I feel like I've read about and worked with it enough to get the gist of how it works and how it's used but I'm not fully proficient with reading and using the technique for all the solutions it's useful for. I will definitely return to practice and work with recursion in the future but for now I am going to give myself a break from it and move on to learning about objects.

### Day 42: June 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished and pushed my blog post. Read more about recursion.

### Day 41: June 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished my blog post but still need to edit and push it.

### Day 40: June 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working on my next blog post. Read more about recursion.

**Thoughts:** I can tell I'll be studying recursion for the next few days. The book I'm studying gets pretty deep into it and from what I've scanned it looks like some of the examples and ideas can get pretty complicated.

### Day 39: June 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked more on my next blog post. Listened to a couple of CodeNewbie podcasts (yes I'm counting informative programming/tech podcasts as part of my 100 DOC).

### Day 38: June 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on a blog post. Started reading about recursion.

**Thoughts:** I've studied recursion before in one of my CS classes. I'm glad to go back over it in this book I've been studying. I think it is important for programmers to understand recursion.

**Today's Progress**: Finished studying methods in C#. Started working on a new blog post.

### Day 36: June 11, 2017

### Day 32: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: (Yesterday) Spent all of my time trying to setup Node.js and MongoDB for testing.

**Thoughts:** This is to test a simple update that I wanted to contribute to freeCodeCamp. Most of my issues were installing MongoDB on my machine. I will hack at it again today.

### Day 31: June 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: (Yesterday) Completed a few exercises from my coding book working with binary. Read about submitting pull requests and contributing to open source.

**Thoughts:** Reading about contributing to open source got me pumped up. Found an issue on freeCodeCamp's issue log that I think I can help with and submit my first PR.

### Day 30: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read more about numeral systems. Made some minor tweaks to my blog site. Practiced using git.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm progressing more and getting better with git. Every day is adding more to the momentum of creating an everyday habit and learning this stuff.

### Day 29: June 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Woke up early and practiced using different arrays in C#. Started reading about numeral systems.

**Thoughts:** I've learned about numeral systems before and worked with binary and hexadecimal numbers but never mastered how to convert and perform operations on them without having to look up references. Not sure how much time I want to put into this topic or if it's even necessary to master it.

### Day 28: June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about multidimensional arrays, jagged arrays, and memory allocation.

**Thoughts:** I plan on working with arrays more tomorrow and creating some gists. Then I will move on to numeral systems.

### Day 21: May 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent all my time proof reading and formatting my blog in Markdown. Then I broke my site trying to push the changes.

**Thoughts:** Pretty frustrated at the amount of time I've spent working on this blog post and still don't have it posted. Not to mention being frustrated with not being able to push my changes correctly with git and breaking my site. Not sure if I will be able to figure out how to fix all the mistakes. May just have to delete the repo and start all over. Also might try the GitHub desktop app since I apparently don't have a clue what I'm doing with git.

### Day 20: May 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Studied and practiced arrays. Finished drafting my blog post. Will post tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Missed a couple of days but got a good session in today. Hopefully about to go on a long streak

### Day 16: May 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use the DateTime structure and format time and dates in C#.

**Thoughts:** Had fun playing with the different custom formats that could be used to display the time and dates. I should write a long blog post about all the stuff I've learned about formatting different strings in the last three days.

### Day 15: May 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up all my gists of code snippets and created a long one about formatting output in C#.

**Today's Progress**: Still working with Hugo. Getting more comfortable with git. Deployed a test page to GitHub Pages.

**Thoughts:** Feeling more confident using Hugo and git. Going to choose a theme tomorrow and start creating the pages and content.

### Day 2: May 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked more with Hugo and played with a few themes for my blog. Learning more about the structure and how things tie together.

**Thoughts:** I assumed using a static site generator would be really fast and easy but the learning curve was a little more than I expected. However I've spent a good chunk of time with it these last two days so I'm going to keep hacking at it. Also I'm still convinced that I would rather have a free static site hosted on GitHub Pages rather than deal with any expenses or security issues from a self hosted CMS or SaaS CMS.

### Day 1: May 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: (Last night) Starting a personal blog. Fought with Hugo static site generator and git. Can't get any themes to load.

**Thoughts:** I thought by the end of the night I would have a template site working with some changes already being made but I can't get any themes to work. I will try again today.
