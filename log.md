### Day 16: May 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use the DateTime structure and format time and dates in C#.

**Thoughts:** Had fun playing with the different custom formats that could be used to display the time and dates. I should write a long blog post about all the stuff I've learned about formatting different strings in the last three days.

### Day 15: May 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up all my gists of code snippets and created a long one about formatting output in C#.

### Day 13: May 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went over conditional statements more and studied if, if-else, and switch statements.

**Thoughts:** Missed yesterday but glad to get back on track.

**Today's Progress**: (From yesterday) Reviewed value and reference types in C#. Wrote a few small programs for the exercises in the book I'm studying.

**Thoughts:** Had fun writing some of the programs for the exercises. Also had fun playing around with a few test programs.

### Day 5: May 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Studying C# again. Read about code decompilation and worked with ILSpy. Reviewed data types.

**Thoughts:** Code decompilation is pretty cool.

### Day 4: May 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I need to tweak some things and add content but I have a blog site on GitHub Pages now.

**Thoughts:** Excited to have a blog online where I can document and share my learning.

### Day 3: May 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Still working with Hugo. Getting more comfortable with git. Deployed a test page to GitHub Pages.

**Thoughts:** Feeling more confident using Hugo and git. Going to choose a theme tomorrow and start creating the pages and content.

### Day 2: May 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked more with Hugo and played with a few themes for my blog. Learning more about the structure and how things tie together.

**Thoughts:** I assumed using a static site generator would be really fast and easy but the learning curve was a little more than I expected. However I've spent a good chunk of time with it these last two days so I'm going to keep hacking at it. Also I'm still convinced that I would rather have a free static site hosted on GitHub Pages rather than deal with any expenses or security issues from a self hosted CMS or SaaS CMS.

### Day 1: May 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: (Last night) Starting a personal blog. Fought with Hugo static site generator and git. Can't get any themes to load.

**Thoughts:** I thought by the end of the night I would have a template site working with some changes already being made but I can't get any themes to work. I will try again today.
