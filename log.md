# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 1, 2017
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: (Last night) Starting a personal blog. Fought with Hugo static site generator and git. Can't get any themes to load.

**Thoughts:** I thought by the end of the night I would have a template site working with some changes already being made but I can't get any themes to work. I will try again today.
