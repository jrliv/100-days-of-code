# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: (Last night) Starting a personal blog. Fought with Hugo static site generator and git. Can't get any themes to load.

**Thoughts:** I thought by the end of the night I would have a template site working with some changes already being made but I can't get any themes to work. I will try again today.

### Day 2: May 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked more with Hugo and played with a few themes for my blog. Learning more about the structure and how things tie together.

**Thoughts:** I assumed using a static site generator would be really fast and easy but the learning curve was a little more than I expected. However I've spent a good chunk of time with it these last two days so I'm going to keep hacking at it. Also I'm still convinced that I would rather have a free static site hosted on GitHub Pages rather than deal with any expenses or security issues from a self hosted CMS or SaaS CMS.
